# CS FORM

It's a contact form, which I used the react framework. Form has option login by passing correct ID.
You can find correct id in data.json or hint : 12355 is one of this.

## Info.

The application allows you to download matters from the server, create new ones or remove unnecessary ones. There is still a lot of things I would like to add, but it will certainly be later on.

## Set up.

To start app you need to enter in the teminal comment, to build envirament:

```bash
yarn
```

I used json server to creat a server, so in order to GET, POST or DELETE data please use termina comment. Of course in folde where the json file are and before you start local app sever.

```bash
json-server -p 4000 data.json
```

To start the local app server, you need to enter :

```bash
yarn start
```

## End.

Enjoy and feel free to correct my code and giveing valuable advice.
